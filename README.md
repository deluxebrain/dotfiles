## Overview

This repository contains dotfiles managed by `chezmoi`, enabling easy setup and
consistent configuration across different systems.

---

## Prerequisites

Before installing, ensure the following:

1. **Xcode or Command Line Developer Tools**: Install via:

   ```sh
   sudo softwareupdate -i -a
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. **Homebrew** (optional): Homebrew will be installed automatically if not
   already present.

3. **Chezmoi**: Installed as part of the setup process.

---

## Installation

To set up your dotfiles, first **fork this repository** to your own GitHub
account, then run the following command in your terminal, replacing
`GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username. This assumes your repository is
named `dotfiles`. The clone will use HTTPS by default.

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply $GITHUB_USERNAME
```

### Suggested installation process

Due to the weight of Brew packages, a full installation can take tens of minutes
to complete. It is therefore advisable to first perform a **minimal
installation**. This will minimize the overall installation time and quickly
reveal any issues across the entire dotfiles installation process without having
to wait for all of the Brew packages to install.

The installation can optionally update your dotfiles GitHub repo to use SSH.
This will be performed if you provide a non-blank response to `gitUserName` when
prompted. A potential installation process is to run the dotfiles first without
specifying your GitHub username and respond `Yes` to the prompt to generate a
default SSH keypair. You can then register this keypair with GitHub and run the
dotfiles installation again, specifying your GitHub username.

This would look as follows:

1. **Perform a Minimal Installation**

   - Select **minimum installation type**
   - Use defaults for all other settings
   - Leave GitHub username and email blank

   ```sh
   sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply
   ```

2. **Add Generated SSH Key to GitHub**
3. **Restart Terminal**
4. **Perform a Full Installation**

   - Select **full installation type**
   - Enter your GitHub username and email

   ```sh
   chezmoi init --prompt --apply
   ```

This will perform a delta to a full install and update the chezmoi dotfiles git
remote to SSH.

---

## Post-installation Steps

1. **Add SSH Key to GitHub** (if generated):

   ```sh
   pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   # Paste into your GitHub account SSH settings
   ```

2. **Verify GitHub SSH Access**:

   ```sh
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

3. **View Managed Files**:

   ```sh
   chezmoi managed
   ```

## Advanced Use Cases

### Creating a New Dotfiles Repository

For a fresh `chezmoi` setup:

chezmoi init
chezmoi cd
git remote add origin git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles.git
git add -A .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

- **Error Visibility**: Ensure errors are easy to spot and debug.
- **Troubleshooting**: Maintain simplicity in troubleshooting.
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear, descriptive messages.
- **Testing**: Test changes thoroughly.
- **Pull Requests**: Include relevant information for reviewers.

---

## Additional Notes

### File Ordering

Scripts are executed in order based on their names. For example:

- `run_once_002_foo` runs **after** `run_onchange_001_bar`.

### Seed Configuration

Some configurations are "seeded" into place for personalization. Changes made to
live configurations wonâ€™t affect the seed unless explicitly updated.

### Run-on-Change Scripts

These scripts are triggered when associated files are modified, ensuring updates
(e.g., package installations) are automatically applied.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this with SSH-based repositories?** A: Yes. Update the clone URL
to use SSH instead of HTTPS.

**Q: What happens if I encounter errors during installation?** A: Ensure
prerequisites are installed and revisit the error message for troubleshooting.
